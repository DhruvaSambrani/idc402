## Computation of stability

$\lambda_2 = \frac{dF(f(x))}{dx}\vert_{x=x_1} = F'(F(x_1))F'(x_1)=F'(x_2)F'(x_1)$

From [[2022-01-25#Stability  of the 2 cycle\|previous class]], stability is attained for $\|4+2r-r^2\| < 1$, that is, $3<r<1+\sqrt{6}\approx3.449$

* $\lambda_2$ at birth of 2 cycle
* then value decreases as r increases
* finally it gets $< -1$ and gives way to $P_4$
  
At birth of $P_4$, it is locally the same as $P_2$

## Bifurcation $r$ pattern

### Figenbaum scaling

$\frac{r_m - r_{m-1}}{r_{m+1} - r_m}\to 4.669 \equiv \delta$
As $m\to \infty$

Accumulation point of an infinite number of period doublings.

## Universal Scaling Relations

Not just logistic map

Typical of period doubling route to chaos

Seen in experiments in variety of physical systems

Hence, 1D map applies to higher dimensional systems.
