## Stability of orbits

**For the tent map or shift map**

$\|\lambda\| = 2$

Dense set of unstable orbits.

Given $x$ and $\epsilon$, there is an unstable orbit in a ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $x$.

Periodic points are countably infinite. They are a measure zero set. Hence "all" points are unstable and chaos is typical.

Consider a histogram of the fraction of time in a finite length orbit originating from a typical initial point falls in N bins of equal size along the x axis.

As $N$ and orbit length $\to\infty$ this probability $\frac{1}{N}$.

Can define a Natural Invariant Density which is the fraction of time typical orbits spend in an interval [x,x+dx].

# Logistic Map

$$x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n)$$

Models generational variation of population. 

## Explanation of terms

If infinite resources,

$$x_{n+1} = r x_n$$

This is an exponential growth.

However, there must be a negative growth rate. 

$$x_{n+1} = -rx_n^2$$

Hence we get the logistic map.

## Properties

1. Max at $x=1/2$ with value $r/4$
2. Zeros are found at 0 and 1
3. For $0\le r\le4$, orbit is bound in $[0,1]$ if $x_0 \in [0,1]$, else runaway to $-\infty$
4. There are [[2022-01-18#Bifurcations\|bifurcations]]

## Bifurcations

Qualitative changes in dynamics which occur as a system parameter varies.
Bifurcations are generic i

### Three types

- Transcritical Bifurcation: Exchange of Stability.
  - Unstable becomes stable and vice versa.
- Tangent Bifurcation: Creating of new fixed points
  - New fixed points appear with half being stable and half unstable
- Period doubling: Creation of new fixed points and Exchange of Stability.
  - Both happen.

Magnitude of Stability Coefficient is 1 at bifurcation point.

**For the logistic map**

Solutions-

$x^\* = 0 \text{ and } x^\* = 1- \frac{1}{r}$. This implies $r \ge 1$ only we have 2 solutions.

For stability, examine $F'(x^\*) = r-2r(x^\*)^2$.

At $x=0$,
$F'(0) = r$

Hence it is stable only if $r<1$.

At $x = 1-1/r$,
$F'(1-1/r) = 2-r$ which is stable only if $r \in [1, 3]$
